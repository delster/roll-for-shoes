# ðŸŒ± Roll for Shoes

This repo will house a web app to host _Roll for Shoes_ games. That logic will be then ported over to bots in various formats; Discord and Slack first, then maybe Facebook Messenger and/or voice assistants.

`The stated goal of this project is to bring joy to people during and after covid-19.`

## What is Roll for Shoes

It's my favorite tabletop game; a massive RPG like _Dungeons & Dragons_ boiled down to its bare minimum. All you need to play is a "character sheet" (pencil and paper), and a handful of d6's (the 6-sided dice you're familiar with from most board games).

## The Rules of Roll for Shoes

You should check out the [post that started this all](http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11348/microdungeons-i-roll-to-see-if-i-have-shoes-on) or [https://rollforshoes.com/](https://rollforshoes.com/), but I'll outline them here:

1. Say what you do and roll a number of d6s.
2. If the sum of your roll is higher than the opposing roll, the thing you wanted to happen, happens.
3. The number of d6s you roll is determined by the level of the skill you have.
4. At start, you have only one skill: Do anything 1.
5. If you roll all sixes, you get a new skill specific to the action, one level higher than the one you used.
6. For every roll you fail, you get 1 XP.
7. XP can be used to change a die into a 6 for advancement purposes only.

## Everything Else

That's it, that's the tweet. Those 7 rules make this a great, short project I can do to help people through a difficult time. Any and all parts of this project are free in every sense I can provide them to you: please share, modify, steal, hoard, or do as you please.
